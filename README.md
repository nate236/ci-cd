# 19 CI-CD: GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup




![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
# Description
s applications grow in complexity, maintaining code quality and ensuring seamless deployments become critical. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential practices that enforce quality checks before merging changes into key branches.

I implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. The pipeline is configured to:

Run Cypress component tests whenever a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, ensuring new changes meet quality standards before merging.
Deploy the application when code is merged from develop to main, automating the release of stable updates.
This workflow ensures code consistency, improves reliability, and streamlines the development process.
